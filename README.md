# Bubble-Sort

Welcome to Bubble Sort! Honestly I feel like this project is going to be relatively simpler compared to the other ones. Since Bubble Sort is just a comparison of elements in an array, this will just require iterating over everything a few times and then and swapping index values. I believe the challenge I will face here is learning how to change array indices. 


After completing this project, it turns out that figuring out how to swap array element indices was not the most difficult part of this, the most difficult part was understanding why a boolean variable was needed to make this sort method function.
