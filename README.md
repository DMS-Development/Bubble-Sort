# Bubble-Sort

Welcome to Bubble Sort! Honestly I feel like this project is going to be relatively simpler compared to the other ones. Since Bubble Sort is just a comparison of elements in an array, this will just require iterating over everything a few times and then and swapping index values. I believe the challenge I will face here is learning how to change array indices.
